The system consists of one school (S), 26 locations (L) and 28 road segments (R). The school and road segments may fail being subjected to hazard scenarios H. Once a hazard event occurs, repair works will take place with priorities S → R0 → R1 → R2 → ... → R28. The works are done only for failed components, and repairing a component takes a day.
Of interest is the expected number of days of education loss for children in each location. A location has access to education when the school and roads it is connected to all survive. 
For example, L20 has access to education if S, R26, R24, R6, R13, and R19 are in operation.
